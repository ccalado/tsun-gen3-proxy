# Contributing to 'TSUN Gen3 Proxy'

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The project aims to bring TSUN third generation inverters (with WiFi support) into local home automation as easily as possible. In some forums the wish was expressed again and again for a solution that keeps the data locally and is not in the cloud. So far I have not found a corresponding solution, and therefore started this project.

The code base of the proxy was created in a few weeks after work and offers many possibilities for collaboration.

Especially in the area of

- docker compose
- packaging
- test automation
- documentation

I would be very happy about support. But also [issue](https://github.com/s-allius/tsun-gen3-proxy/issues) reports and [discussions](https://github.com/s-allius/tsun-gen3-proxy/discussions) are welcome.

There is only one rule, our [code of conduct](https://github.com/s-allius/tsun-gen3-proxy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Cheers, Stefan Allius
